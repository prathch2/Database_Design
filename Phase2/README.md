# Description:
Sports play a major role in the entertainment and fitness industry. From the players to audience engagement, they play a significant role in the success of sport teams; especially teams and clubs at universities. With sports having a lot of moving parts, a lot of data is formed and needed to be sorted and analyzed. Sports can include data from members and match information such as health data, emergency contacts, athlete records, game records, and other team records to finance data such as expenses and funding. By organizing this data into a database, managers and players can pull this data and create actionable insights towards future media engagement, finances, and player efficiency. In order to organize a sport organization’s data and create actionable insights towards their organization’s performance, we will create a database management system containing 7 different entities: Member, Player Stats, League, Matches, Academic Performance, Expense, and Injuries. These relations will have attributes with primary and foreign keys that will help to identify and organize the data. With cardinality relationships, each relation is joined accordingly. For example, Members relation will have student ID as a primary key along with other attributes regarding the individual. The members relation has a 1:1 cardinality relationship with Player Stats and a 1 to many relation with Injuries. The Entity-relationship diagram describes connections between relations in greater detail while the Relational Schemas and Functional Dependencies document will provide detail regarding attributes, types, domain, and constraints. The system’s functionality is able to provide a result to distinct schemas regarding the sports organization. With the goal of solving data organization and analysis problems in Cricket, This database will be used in school, and cricket sports clubs and organization environments. With the implementation of a web application, the utility of the database is increased. We will be using php to create a web application and connect the database to the web application. 

# Users:
People like captains, organization chairs, administrators, and the public can access parts or all of the database based on what they are authorized to see. For example Player’s Cricket Stats (Player Stats table) could be shown to the public while personal information (Member table) can only be accessed by administrators. Expenses and Leagues table would be useful for organization chairs while Matches and Injuries would be helpful for team captains. **The Users that will be regristered in this database will incude: Captains and Organization Chairs.**

# Lessons Learned: 
For this project, we had a lot of difficulties and obstacles to face. When working on ddl, Our strength for this project was when creating the 20 queries and constructing the tables for the database. using visual studio live share, we bout were able to collaborate and work on the ddl and dml together, discussing the functionality of the database and what possible changes we have to make to our original ER diagram. Our weaknes was when we started working on php side of the project. Both of us had a dificult time not just completing the task, but communicating and working together. We both had different ideas for what work we wished to do. As the deadline got closer, we started communicating more and working on resolving errors our codes were giving.
Pratham: If i was provided another opportunity, I would try to set "deliverables or fake deadlines" that way we stay on track. I also wish I looked into php more and spent more time on php. 
Smit: One thing I could have done differently if I was given another opportunity and extra time, is adding more fields of cricket into this DBMS. Cricket is a very deep sport with lots and lots of factors that decides important points about the game. Having those points would help focus the DBMS to have a more impact on coaching decisions that would lead to a more successful sports team.


# Improvements to Semester Project:
I feel this semester project lack directions and guidence on what to do. It felt like majority of the work in the project started to happen near the end of the semester. For creating the database and the 20 queries, we felt well prepared and confident in our work. As we got to the php side of the project, It started to feel very lost but the teacher did a very good job helping everyone. We also struggles and spent a lot of time trying to figure out how triggers and procedures work. One improvement i feel will significantly help is going over triggers and procedures earlier in the senester adn having more proactice on triggers and procedures. I felt I wasted alot of time trying to get the trigger and procedures to work and ending up not being able to figure it out.
